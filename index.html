    <h2 id="welcome-header">Hello,</h2>
    <h2>It's nice to meet you!</h2>
    <p class="big-paragraph">I'm Lauren. I'm a writer with a background in magazine writing and editing. In December, I'll graduate from the Missouri School of Journalism with a bachelors in journalism, emphasis in magazine writing and a minor in Portuguese.

    Currently, I contribute to KC magazine's internet outlet, ThisIsKC.com, to Feast magazine's web section called "The Feed" and to TulsaPeople magazine. In September, I will travel to Atlanta to represent the University of Missouri as a student ambassador at the SEC Symposium and jet off to Las Vegas as a Society of American Travel Writers annual conference intern.

    This semester I'm recoding this website from scratch (my senior honor's project), so please use the teal buttons to learn more about me.</p>
