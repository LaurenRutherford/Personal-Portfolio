        <p>I answered Feast’s call for writers covering the food and drink scene in Mid-Missouri. Feast is a large-format print magazine that is a source for all things food scene in the state of Missouri. I primarily write for FeastMagazine.com’s “The Feed” section. Keeping a careful eye on the happenings in Columbia, I pitch, report, research, write and fact-check stories on the city’s best tastes. On occasion, I take the photos for my stories.</p>

          <p>I held my first magazine internship during summer 2013. I primarily fact-checked and proofread stories for the print publication and wrote weekly for The Weekender blog. During my sophomore winter break, I returned to those duties. Now as a freelance writer, I report and write the assignments given to me. I primarily write Q-and-A’s with Tulsa’s coolest crowd.</p>

            <p>After working as a digital and print editor in the spring, I continued with Vox as a contributing writer. I pitched and wrote blogs and Q-and-A’s as well as department pieces that were assigned to me. My biggest success of the summer was pitching, reporting and writing a over 2,000 word feature about the role social media plays in spreading awareness and raising money for those who are terminally ill. The story centered on Columbia native Bryson, a 5-year-old with a DIPG tumor, and his Facebook page with over 24,000 likes.</p>

              <p>I spent one month as a student reporter for the Columbia Missourian, a student-powered and faculty-led daily publication. I wrote and fact-checked stories on all topics every day, and I produced two feature-length pieces that ran above the fold on the front page. During general assignment shifts, I wrote obituaries (or as the Missourian calls Life Stories) and quick briefs. Throughout my time there, I had the opportunity to social media as a storytelling method. I even broke the news of a councilman’s death after finding a tip on Twitter.</p>

              <div>
                <p>My quest to revamp The Maneater’s social media presence began after attending the Associated Collegiate Press conference in New Orleans in October 2013. I decided that our publication could do a lot better. Long story short, I invented a planning system and introduced our newsroom to Hootsuite. I most formally took on the social media editor role as Outreach Editor.</p>

                <p>In spring 2014, my consistent and systematic posting to our accounts gained us NUMBER new Facebook likes and NUMBER new Twitter followers. I helped to implement social media as a method of storytelling by using Storify and posting embeds.</p>

                <p>As I transitioned to Managing Editor, I didn’t feel my system was ready to pass along to others. I honed the system, and in October upon my resignation, created a social media editor position. I trained two staff members to run The Maneater’s accounts, and I’m proud to say it’s a position that the staff maintains today. Just last spring, The Maneater Twitter account passed 10,000 followers and earned a verified check mark.</p>

As Managing Editor, I edited all content that went to print as well as some online exclusive content. I managed our staff, often solving problems and engaging in conflict resolution, and payroll. Every week I organized and helped lead a workshop for our staff. In the transition from Outreach/Opinion editor to Managing Editor, I kept my social media editor role and continued to grow the publication’s presence online. If you’d like to know more about why I had to leave this position earlier than expected, please ask.</p>

              <p>As Opinion/Outreach Editor, I selected a team of columnists, edited their columns weekly, decided which columns would appear in print and laid out the pages. My other duties included managing The Maneater’s social media accounts and writing the weekly editorial.</p>
