        <p>I answered Feast’s call for writers covering the food and drink scene in Mid-Missouri. Feast is a large-format print magazine that is a source for all things food scene in the state of Missouri. I primarily write for FeastMagazine.com’s “The Feed” section. Keeping a careful eye on the happenings in Columbia, I pitch, report, research, write and fact-check stories on the city’s best tastes. On occasion, I take the photos for my stories.</p>

      Vox Magazine
      Contributing Writer, May-August 2015

      After working as a digital and print editor in the spring, I continued with Vox as a contributing writer. I pitched and wrote blogs and Q-&-A’s as well as department pieces that were assigned to me. My biggest success of the summer was pitching, reporting and writing a over 2,000 word feature about the role social media plays in spreading awareness and raising money for those who are terminally ill. The story centered on Columbia native Bryson, a 5-year-old with a DIPG tumor, and his Facebook page with over 24,000 likes.

      Columbia Missourian
      Reporter, July-August 2014

      I spent one month as a student reporter for the Columbia Missourian, a student-powered and faculty-led daily publication. I wrote and fact-checked stories on all topics every day, and I produced two feature-length pieces that ran above the fold on the front page. During general assignment shifts, I wrote obituaries (or as the Missourian calls Life Stories) and quick briefs. Throughout my time there, I had the opportunity to social media as a storytelling method. I even broke the news of a councilman’s death after finding a tip on Twitter.
